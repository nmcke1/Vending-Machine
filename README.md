# Vending-Machine
Software Design Principles Coursework
Using the coding practices we were taught in class such as programming to interfaces we were tasked with designing a vending machine which would hold item objects and allow the user to buy these items. It also required biometrics for the user to confrim there identity as well as an option to change the currency. It also needed a location checker and a purchase log was to be printed after every transaction showing item time and date and stock levels.
